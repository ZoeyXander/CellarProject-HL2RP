# CellarProject HL2RP

This is client-side code of the largest server, at the time of its existence, Half-Life 2 role-playing Russian community "CELLAR-PROJECT".

## Features

- This is client-side and shared files only. 
- No bugs and decompilation bugs will be fixed.


## FAQ

#### "Do you realize that the CellarProject and Lovelands schemas you posted on github are completely nonfunctional? Despite you saying they are free to use. You said no bugs will be fixed, but neither of the schemas are even usable." - Commentator from steam workshop "Lovelands 2055 Content - Base".

I emphasize again, this code is a client-side, it is not suitable for standalone use for server. You can't download it and put it on your server, you have to do the server part in this case. 
## Usage
Use at your own pleasure.
